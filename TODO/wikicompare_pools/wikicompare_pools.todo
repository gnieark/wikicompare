With this module, the deepest criteria will be able to became a pool instead of the classical Yes/No with debate system.

This way, the visitor will be able to give a note for this criteria, and the percentage of the evaluation will become the average of each vote. I would be better if not everyone can vote, because some entreprises may try to manipulate the results.

This bring subjectivity and posibility of manipulation, something we absolutely do not want. The classical Yes/No should always be preffered when we can have an absolute proof that the product respect the criteria.
Unfortunately, we do not have always this absolute proof and in such case, this pool system may have some use.
